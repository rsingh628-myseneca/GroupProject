Project Introduction:
Create a project that can check the format of the output

PH: previousBlockHash
D: data
RN: randomNumber
CH: currentBlockhash
blank line
Next block
Repeat for all blocks

The second Python file verifies that all of the values match the question and demonstrate that they are all valid. the previousBlockHash should not be empty and create 
the previous block's hash, then compare it. The random number digit that is present in the currentblock hash is legitimate. Replace the currentBlockhash value with the 
one from iteration 1 and compare it to the one taken from the file. The block is valid if all three conditions are satisfied,Â Show error if not.

Program Working:
The block from Iteration #1. The output format is for py. It will display the currentBlockhash, randomNumber, data, and previousBlockHash. and for each block, it will
be repeated. With the sampledata.txt file, 4 records or data for 4 semesters will be displayed.
The previousBlockHash is checked to see whether it is not empty in teration #2 of bcvalidator.py. and create the previous block's hash, then compare it. The random number
digit that is present in the currentblock hash is legitimate. Replace the currentBlockhash value with the one from iteration 1 and compare it to the one taken from the
file. If the above is correct, check the following block until they are all valid; if not, display an error and exit. Finalize the comparison of all blockchains with the
data and demonstrate that they are all correct.
